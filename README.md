Module 13 Challenge

Start by importing pandas, sklearn.model_selection - train_test split
and from sklearn.metrics - accuracy_score.

Retreive the spam data by using the pd.read_csv and view and review the data set.

The predictions will be made using 2 models the Logistic Regression and the Random Forests Classifer. Make a prediction of which model will preform better and write it down.

Split the data by creating the X features and y label as spam. Review the data frame. Check the label variables of y by using value_counts.

Split the data using the train_test_split function.

Using the StandardScaler cale the training data.

Transform both the training and testing features using the transform function.

Create a Logistic Regression model, fit the training data and make predictions on the testing data. 

Calculate the accuracy score.

Create and fit a Random Forest Classifier model.

Make predictions using the testing data and calculate the accuracy score by using the accuracy_score function.

Lastly, evaluate the models and compare the results to your prediction.
